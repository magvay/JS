Package Control Messages
========================

CSS3
----

  Thank you for installing CSS3! It's strongly recommended that you disable the
  default CSS package, as its completions will interfere with the improved CSS3
  completions.
  
  Mac:           cmd+shift+p  -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS
  Linux/Windows: ctrl+shift+p -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS
  
  If you have Emmet installed, its completions will drown out the completions
  in CSS3. You can disable Emmet's completions by adding the following lines
  to your Emmet package settings:
  
  	"show_css_completions": false,
  	"disable_tab_abbreviations_for_scopes": "source.css"
  
  That's it. Enjoy the plugin. If you have any problems, please open an issue on
  Github and I'll fix it as soon as I can.
